### **4.2 Syllabus**
* A syllabus is n eeded for each topic
* The syllabus may be supplied by us and stored in the database
* If no syllabus exists, one should be created for the user based on the topic
* Syllabus might be found by searching online then using the results to construct
a new syllabus operating down to the level of short lessons making up a module.
* Each short lesson will start with no more than 5 minutes worth of exposition.
* An example syllabus follows:
